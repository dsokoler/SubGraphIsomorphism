# SubGraphIsomorphism
CS355 Zero Knowlege Subgraph Isomorphism - Daniel Sokoler, Lala Vaishno De

How to run directly as Eclipse project?
1. Make a new java project in Eclipse called SubGraphIsomorphism with the directory: /SubGraphIsomorphism/  (this is where you 
  have cloned the git repo)
2. All the files will be imported into the Eclipse project.


Notes : when you do isomorphism, make a new object that using the same adjacency matrix and call doIsomorphism using that. Else the original gets messed up (No idea why)
